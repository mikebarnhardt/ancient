ANCIENT
An experimental CSS library with some add-ons:
  themes, icons, illustrations, and patterns.

This system is not meant to be a complete framework and assumes you can create
and extend your own components in your chosen framework (React, Vue, Angular,
etc.).

It is intentionally left open-ended and it is highly encouraged to create your
own repository extending the functionality you want.
